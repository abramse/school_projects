# Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Web App Database

Using the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Property Level Data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), my database application organizes and allow users to query and view information regarding the locations and characteristics of tax credit properties in the United States. Users, particularly affordable housing nonprofits, housing finance agencies, real estate syndicators, and other parties interested in affordable housing, will find this app useful to understand where existing properties are located, who they serve, and what are the housing characteristics. 

Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties are typically multifamily dwellings, such as apartment buildings, that are financed and constructed (or, in many cases, existing buildings are rehabilitated or renovated) through public-private partnerships. They serve a very important purpose by providing affordable housing options to low-income individuals and families.

This app will allow users to find answers to questions such as, “Where are LIHTC properties in my area?”, “How many units and bedrooms do the properties have?”, “What special populations do the properties serve?”, and “What type of federal funding is used to finance these properties?” In addition to answering those questions, I would also like this tool to be used in such a way that affordable housing nonprofits, housing finance agencies, and real estate syndicators can identify areas and populations that may need or benefit from tax credit properties.
